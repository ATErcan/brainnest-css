  <h1> CSS </h1>
	<h4>
		1. What are the main differences between external, internal, and 
		inline CSS?
	</h4>
	<p>
		The place that we write our css code is the main difference. But this 
		also affects the issue of which style code is applied.
	</p>

	<h4> 2. What is the syntax for class and ID selectors? </h4>
	<p> Dot(.) for classes (.class), hash(#) for id's (#id) </p>

	<h4>
		3. How would you apply a single rule to two different selectors?
	</h4>
	<p> 
		We select both elements with selectors and seperate them with comma, 
		then we can give any rule we want.
	</p>

	<h4>
		4. Given an element that has an id of title and a class of primary, 
		how would you use both attributes for a single rule?
	</h4>
	<p> #title.primary </p>

	<h4> 5. What does the descendant combinator do?	</h4>
	<p>
		Selects the every element inside of parent element. Doesn't matter how 
		nested element is.
	</p>

	<h4>
		6. Between a rule that uses one class selector and a rule that uses 
		three type selectors, which rule has the higher specificity?
	</h4>
	<p> Class </p>

	<h4>
		7. From inside to outside, what is the order of box-model properties?
	</h4>
	<p> Content, padding, border, margin </p>

	<h4> 8. What does the box-sizing CSS property do? </h4>
	<p> Specifies the behavior of width and height properties. </p>

	<h4>
		9. What is the difference between the standard and alternative 
		box model?
	</h4>
	<p>
		The difference between standard and alternative box models is how they 
		handle padding and borders. Standard box-model doesn't include paddings 
		and borders in width and height properties. On the other hand, 
		alternative box-model does include.
	</p>

	<h4>
		10. Would you use margin or padding to create more space between 
		2 elements?
	</h4>
	<p>	Margin </p>

	<h4>
		11. Would you use margin or padding to create more space between 
		the contents of an element and its border?
	</h4>
	<p> Padding </p>

	<h4>
		12. Would you use margin or padding if you wanted two elements to 
		overlap each other?
	</h4>
	<p> Margin </p>

	<h4>
		13. What is the difference between a block element and an inline 
		element?
	</h4>
	<p>
		A block element occupies the entire line, regardless of the width of 
		the content in it. On the other hand, inline element takes up as much 
		space as the content inside of it.
	</p>

	<h4>
		14. What is the difference between an inline element and an 
		inline-block element?
	</h4>
	<p>
		Inline elements do not take properties such as margin, padding from top 
		or bottom. Animations do not work on these elements. But these properties 
		work for inline-block elements.
	</p>

	<h4> 15. Is an h1 block or inline? </h4>
	<p>	Block </p>

	<h4> 16. Is button block or inline? </h4>
	<p> Inline </p>

	<h4> 17. Is div block or inline? </h4>
	<p> Block </p>

	<h4> 18. Is span block or inline? </h4>
	<p> Inline </p>

	<h4>
		19. What’s the difference between a flex container and a flex 
		item?
	</h4>
	<p>
		A flex container is the element that takes the display-flex property. It is 
		not aligned, it contains elements that are aligned. Flex-item, on the other 
		hand, is the aligned element inside the flex-container.
	</p>

	<h4> 20. How do you create a flex item? </h4>
	<p>	Giving display property which takes flex value to it's parent element. </p>
	
	<h4>
		21. What are the 3 values defined in the shorthand flex property?
	</h4>
	<p> flex-grow, flex-shrink, flex-basis </p>

	<h4>
		22. How do you make flex items arrange themselves vertically 
		instead of horizontally?
	</h4>
	<p>
		With flex-direction property which takes column or column-reverse value.
	</p>

	<h4>
		23. What is the difference between justify-content and align-items?
	</h4>
	<p>
		As default justify-content aligns elements horizontally and align-items 
		aligns elements vertically. However flex-direction property can change 
		the axis and if that happens, those 2 properties switch roles.
	</p>

	<h4>
		24. How do you use flexbox to completely center a div inside a flex 
		container?
	</h4>
	<p>
		With giving flex-container the following properties:
		display: flex;
		justify-content: center;
		align-items: center;		
	</p>

	<h4>
		25. What’s the difference between justify-content: space-between and 
		justify-content: space-around?
	</h4>
	<p>
		space-between leans the first and last elements to the edges and aligns
		the other elements with equal spaces.
		space-around puts some space between the first-last element and the 
		edges	close to them, and aligns them with the other elements by keeping 
		the space a little wider.
	</p>
